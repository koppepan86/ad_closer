# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Chrome拡張機能において「Required permission missing: activeTab」エラーが発生している問題を解決する。Manifest V3の`activeTab`権限は特殊な動作をするため、適切な権限管理システムと代替手段を実装する必要がある。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension developer, I want the activeTab permission to work correctly, so that the extension can access the current tab's content and perform its intended functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the activeTab permission SHALL be properly declared in manifest.json
2. WHEN a user interacts with the extension action THEN the activeTab permission SHALL be automatically granted for the current tab
3. WHEN the activeTab permission is not available THEN the extension SHALL gracefully degrade to alternative methods
4. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension user, I want the extension to work reliably across different websites, so that popup blocking functionality is consistently available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting any HTTP/HTTPS website THEN the extension SHALL have appropriate permissions to function
2. WHEN the extension lacks sufficient permissions THEN it SHALL request additional permissions from the user
3. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the extension SHALL continue to work with reduced functionality
4. WHEN permission status changes THEN the extension SHALL adapt its behavior accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension developer, I want comprehensive permission debugging tools, so that I can quickly identify and resolve permission-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all permission checks and their results
3. WHEN permission validation is run THEN the system SHALL test all required permissions and report status
4. WHEN permission issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for resolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension, I want to handle Manifest V3 permission limitations properly, so that the extension works reliably in the modern Chrome extension environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using activeTab permission THEN the system SHALL understand it only works after user interaction
2. WHEN activeTab is not available THEN the system SHALL use alternative permission strategies
3. WHEN host permissions are needed THEN the system SHALL request them appropriately
4. WHEN optional permissions are required THEN the system SHALL request them dynamically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension user, I want clear feedback about permission status, so that I understand why certain features may not be working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permissions are missing THEN the user SHALL receive clear notification about the issue
2. WHEN permission requests are made THEN the user SHALL understand what permissions are needed and why
3. WHEN the extension is in degraded mode THEN the user SHALL be informed about limited functionality
4. WHEN permissions are restored THEN the user SHALL be notified that full functionality is available
